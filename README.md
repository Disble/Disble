### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here Disble speaks.

This space is only for comment things that right now I'm doing.

For example:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Vue.js and JavaScript in depth (also a little bit of Python).
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on personal project that Iâ€™m inspired the other day using GOG Galaxy app and I'm creating an app box ([dbox](https://github.com/Disble/dbox)) where you can group your apps.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm actually, built a project in electron for management anime episodes only for I can't remember in what episode I stayed in each week (repository [here](https://github.com/Disble/automatizar-tareas)).
