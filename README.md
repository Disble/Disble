### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here Disble speaks.

This space is only for comment things that right now I'm doing.

For example:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Machine Learning and Python.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on own personal brand, so this text is part of it.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about JavaScript, it's my first programming languaje (and future second).
- âš¡ Fun fact: Work with Threejs and Babylonjs it's harder than i thought.

So, that's all. 

See you next time.
