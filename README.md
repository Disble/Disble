### Hi there 👋

Here Disble speaks.

This space is only for comment things that right now I'm doing.

For example:

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Vue.js and JavaScript in depth (also a little bit of Python).
- 🔭 I’m currently working on personal project where I'm trying implements Gamification (it's a little bit harder than I thought).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm actually, built a project in electron for management anime episodes only for I can't remember in what episode I stayed in each week (repository [here](https://github.com/Disble/automatizar-tareas)).
